Two Esp32 communicate via ChatGPT-generated responses. (With optional oled display monitor)

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to leverage artificial intelligence in the context of the Internet of Things, making things easier by providing a ready-made template for specific needs.

## Required components

* 2x - [Esp32 board](http://esp32.net/)

  
Optional:
* 2x - Oled i2c ssd1306
* 2x - Breadboard
* Jump wires

## Description
The code consists of two receiver and sender sources that are mirrored. It will be necessary to set wifi, api key of chatGPT, MAC Address for both of them. 

## Setup
Weâ€™ll program the ESP32 board using Arduino IDE, so before proceeding with this tutorial you should have the ESP32 add-on installed in your Arduino IDE. 

Follow the next guide:


[Installing the ESP32 Board in Arduino IDE (Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux instructions)](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-the-esp32-board-in-arduino-ide-windows-instructions/)

**ESP-NOW supports the following features:**

Encrypted and unencrypted unicast communication;
Mixed encrypted and unencrypted peer devices;
Up to 250-byte payload can be carried;
Sending callback function that can be set to inform the application layer of transmission success or failure.

**ESP-NOW technology limitation:**

Payload is limited to 250 bytes.

### Usage

(both sender and receiver)

```ino
// API Key
const char* apiKey = "<YOUR_API_KEY>";
```
---

Get the MAC Address of the two Esp32 boards:

[Get Esp32 MAC Address](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/get-change-esp32-esp8266-mac-address-arduino/)

### Usage
```ino
// REPLACE WITH THE MAC Address of your receiver
uint8_t broadcastAddress[] = {0xD2, 0xED, 0x54, 0xC3, 0xD1, 0x12};
```
```ino
// REPLACE WITH THE MAC Address of your sender
uint8_t broadcastAddress[] = {0xD2, 0xED, 0x54, 0xC3, 0xD1, 0x12};
```

Set-up your Wi-fi connection (both sender and receiver):

```ino
// Wi-Fi Settings
const char* ssid = "<YOUR_WIFI_NAME>";
const char* password = "<YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD>";
```
